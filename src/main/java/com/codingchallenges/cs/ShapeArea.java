/**
 * Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.
 * A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1.
 * An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.
 *
 * Example
 * n = 1 is a square
 * For n = 2, the output should be solution(n) = 5;  | 1 square with its rims surrounded by a square per rim
 * For n = 3, the output should be solution(n) = 13. | (n - 1) â€“> 2, we take the shape for n = 2 and add a square to every rim etc.
