# **Coding Challenges Repository**

Welcome to my repository, a place where I explore algorithmic challenges and data structure problems. This is where I document my journey through various coding exercises, focusing on improving my skills and understanding in software development.

## Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of coding problems. The exercises I've worked on cover a range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and more, selected to challenge my current skills and push me to learn more.

## Objectives
This repository reflects my ongoing journey in software development, showcasing my efforts to solve problems and learn from each challenge. It serves multiple purposes:

* **Learning**: A record of my progress and a way to track my learning over time.
* **Interview Preparation**: A collection of exercises that mirror the kind of problems often seen in technical interviews, though it's a reflection of my learning process rather than an exhaustive preparation tool.
* **Skill Demonstration:** An opportunity to show potential collaborators and employers my approach to solving problems and learning new concepts, even as I continue to develop my skills.

## Technologies
Currently, all solutions are implemented in Java. As I continue to explore and learn, I may expand into other programming languages, but for now, Java is my primary focus.

## Contribution
Feedback and suggestions from the community are always welcome. If you have any advice or would like to discuss the solutions further, feel free to reach out.

This repository is a personal project for educational purposes. It's about my journey in improving my coding skills and is not intended for commercial use or as an official guide.
